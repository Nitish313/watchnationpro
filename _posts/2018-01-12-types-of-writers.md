## Subject Matter Experts

They need to have in-depth knowledge of a particular subject, domain, product, or service. So they are the ones who have a deep understanding of this specific area within a specific industry. And these would be the people who would be writing textbooks, e-books white papers, and  giving like a lot of suggestions and research papers relevant to their industry and their domain.

For example, some of the subject matter experts available in the IT domain are developers and QA testers. They act as SMEs for the IT products they are dealing with. They can write their own content based on their expert knowledge. As a technical writer, we must be in constant touch with these SMEs and hold an interview, whenever necessary, with the SMEs to get to know about the product.

## Generalists
So these generalist writers are jacks of all trades, basically. They can be great choices for high volume and short awareness-level content. And this type of writing does not require a lot of expertise, unlike subject matter experts. They can write on any topic based on comprehensive online research.


## SEO generalist
SEO generalist is basically anyone who has a little knowledge about SEO.
In fact, a lot of knowledge about SEO is required for writers these days rather than following the principle of "Write and Submit". Knowledge about SEO is required to bring people to read it online.

If you do not know what is SEO, let me explain. Let us assume that Sam wants to know about insects places a search query in Google, for example, using the keyword "spiders."

What happens now?
1. Google bots make a quick organic search of all the pages available on the internet regarding insects.
2. Google selects the best and most informative content and displays it on top of the results page for you to view it.
3. Google selects the next best content below.
4. Google selects the third best content below...and so on.
Now Sam clicks the first result insects and reads it, and he is happy to learn about spiders.

So, What did the page writers do to make the pages reach the top. The writer who created the page that is listed at the top knows how to make the content the "best"? He has followed certain rules or procedures to make the content the "best So, he knows how to optimize the content for the search engines like google.

In this internet world, every writer must know how to make their content SEO ready so that it can drive people through search engines to read it. ."

How can you make a content SEO ready? By contacting an SEO generalist. They know the tactics to make normal content (written by an SME or generalist) into an SEO ready content. So they look into the generalist content, and they will analyze to see if everything matches to the SEO standards, whether it has content that will have a good organic reach, and make changes to it before published online.

What will happen when the content is not made SEO ready?
Let us assume that if a subject matter experts have written each and every detail and everything that people want to read. But if the SEO copywriter did not make your blog content SEO ready, even if the blog content is highly informative written by a subject matter expert, even then, it is not going to be reaching out to the right audience or gain traffic.

So SEO generalists are a very important layer in the creative in the content writing industry. That is why, even in the job descriptions that you will see, the basics of an SEO understanding are always preferred.

## UX/UI Writers

So they are involved with writing the core pages for the websites like the links, the buttons, and make sure that the website or the app is convenient to use according to the hierarchy of information.
So if you see an app and if you don't find it user friendly, it does not matter how good the app is. You do not want to stay any longer on the app.
Right?
So, a UX designer is the one who would be designing the app.
For example, if you are playing a game. So you want to exit the game now because maybe for whatever reason. What is going to happen when you exit the game. You are going to get two buttons displayed on your screen: one is the continue button, and the other one is the exit button.
So what happens to come to you seems to be highlighted, and the exit is generally great. This gives you the impression that you can not press the exit until you press the button. When you press to come to you again, you are staying longer on their application. These are the tricks that are designed by the UX designer wanting people to stay long on the application, website, etc.
So they are the ones who would also be looking into things like the following:
* Is the arrangement of the information is proper or not?
* Is the navigation of the pages is easy or not?
* Is the navigation hindered by anything?

## Lead Generation writer     

These are the people who are into bulk emails. They need to have strong knowledge and persuasive writing in order to make the content effective.
They need to incorporate a lot of selling strategy since content needs to have a lot of the * Call To Action in the following articles like:
sales letter
landing pages.

Now, if you have a graphic design course, and there is a lead generation writer who can send out emails to ten thousand emails saying that you have come up with a self-paced course for graphic design. Out of the 10,000 emails sent as a bulk email, maybe five thousand may show interest and click the mail. Out of 5000, maybe just five hundred may actually turn out to buy the course.
So this is how it works.
You're writing in bulk in order to expect a call to action from the audience.
So it's like that kind of a thing you know they may, or they may not show interest, but you need to ensure the following is done:
* Make the mail more interactive
* Make the mail more engaging.
* Mail must not look like spam.
* Mail must make the reader think, "what's in it for me?"

If I happened to buy your product, what's the value for me.
So all this has to be focused on your sales pitch, which would be written and generated by the lead generation writers. They are the ones who would focus on getting the deals for the business.
So what's if you say that "YES! I AM INTERESTED. GIVE ME MORE INFORMATION" as a lead.
Right.
Then you have your sales team contacting the leads and trying to kind of make them purchase the product or service.


-----------------------------


Then next you have your influences influenced us.
These these are these influences they would add credibility to your content to the niche market and
their audience.
It's because of their influence that they are trying and pushing your product because of the influence
that they have on their audience or on that far less people would want to.
Likely you'll see a product your syllabuses or whatsoever.
So if at all you want to open celebrities Instagram influencers these days Influence marketing is also
like a major thing.
So on Instagram so if I have you know there is no age or goes the age yet that's a lot of make up reviews
and she has like 20000 plus followers.
Right.
So maybe if I'm a newbie into the industry with my line of makeup products I would not afford celebrities.
Right.
So they're pretty expensive to get the men to endorse my product.
So what I believe said look at these small time influencers like 20000 thousand people who have followers
and stuff like that.
I would approach them and I would like you know contact them and see how it works and what's their charges
and stuff that and ask them to kind of give a review on my product already you know to kind of influence
their audience that my product or you know just basically to advertise for my product using that influence.
