It took fifteen minutes for their family members to realize that Celina had fallen down. She was taken to the hospital to find out her health conditions. Doctor measured Celina's heartbeat, diabeties level, body temperature and said that all were normal. Sam was relieved there after. Now, sam is watching his mom sipping her coffee, while his mobile received a call from his office.
