# What is a writing style, and how to use writing styles?

The writing style is a way of writing that an author follows to convey their views and messages in a fashion that is meaningful to their audience.

As an author, what do you want your target audience to know, feel, or do. If you are clear on this factor, then writing may come very easily to you.
Just ask few questions to yourself before you start writing something.

Do you want your audience to gain knowledge about something?

Do you want your audience to buy something?

Do you want your audience to experience something?

So have a simple idea of what you want to write and what action your target audience must make. It is as simple as that.

## Types of writing styles

There are four types of writing styles.

* Expository
* Descriptive
* Persuasive
* Narrative

Let us discuss all the writing styles one by one.

### Expository Writing Style

In the expository writing style, as an author, you will be explaining or informing about a topic and do not give your own opinion about the topic. The goal is to explain the concept or important information to a broader audience. You as an author will focus only on the facts about the topic and include statistics or other evidence available. You must not give any opinion about the topic.

Refer to some of the examples of this kind of writing here:

* [How-to articles](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10startfresh)
* [Recipes] (https://butterwithasideofbread.com/homemade-bread/)
* [Textbooks](https://www.amazon.in/dp/1497408180?tag=hackr0df-21)
* [Technical Manual](https://library.e.abb.com/public/77e14a51c87d49aeba777e288ec93530/NextECMUpload_1874426_20200221161922.pdf)
* [Business writing](https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-smartphone-share/)
* [Scientific writing](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/evaluating-covid-risk-on-planes-trains-and-automobiles2/)

If you refer to any of the following example articles, you can notice that the author explains or informs about a particular topic, and they do not impart or say any opinion about it. You cannot find any words or phrases appreciating or talking high about the Windows OS that it is a great OS, or about the taste of the bread that it is lip smacking etc. This kind of writing will merely explain what is the process and that's it. Hence the author will be neutral about the subject.

It is necessary to know about other styles of writing also. You can learn more about other skills if you are interested in writing any other writing styles too.

### Descriptive Writing Style

In descriptive writing, as an author you will be giving a lot of details around a person, place, or event. The author's goal is to share details and give readers a sensory experience of what is going on (what they hear, see, smell, taste, or touch).

### Persuasive Writing Style

In a persuasive writing style, the author tries to convince the audience about their opinions and beliefs.

The style of writing will have the author's opinion and biases. It will also justify the reason with evidence to prove the correctness in their position.
